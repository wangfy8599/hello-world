% key  
The % key can be used for the following :  

 - To jump to a matching opening or closing parenthesis, square bracket or a curly brace: ([{}])
 - To jump to start or end of a C-style comment: /* */.
 - To jump to a matching C/C++ preprocessor conditional: #if, #ifdef, #else, #elif, #endif.
 - To jump between appropriate keywords, if supported by the ftplugin file, for example, between begin and end in a Pascal program.
